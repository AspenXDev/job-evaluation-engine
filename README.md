# Job Evaluation Engine

A structured decision engine for evaluating job opportunities through stability, scope clarity, and cognitive sustainability.

This repository currently represents Phase 1 of a multi-stage evolution toward a generalized structured evaluation engine.

---

## Purpose

The Job Evaluation Engine provides:

- Structured analysis of job descriptions
- Weighted scoring across defined dimensions
- Standardized output schema for decision clarity
- Modular design for future CLI and API integration

This is not a job search assistant. It is an evaluation engine.

---

## Design Philosophy

This engine does not optimize for:

- Prestige
- Title acceleration
- Compensation maximization
- Ego validation

It prioritizes:

- Defined scope
- Clear reporting lines
- Structured environments
- Sustainable workload
- Long-term psychological stability

The goal is not prediction.
The goal is clarity of trade-offs.

---

## When This Engine Is Not Appropriate

- High-risk founder decisions
- Aggressive career acceleration strategies
- Pure compensation optimization
- Situations requiring intuition over structure

---

## Evolution Roadmap

Phase 1 — Prompt Architecture (Completed)
Phase 2 — Wrapped Execution (In Progress)
Phase 3 — Programmatic Scoring Engine
Phase 4 — Recruiter Intelligence Layer
Phase 5 — Comparative Portfolio Evaluation

---

## Current Architecture

core/ -> Evaluation logic and scoring specifications

prompts/ -> LLM interaction layer

config/ -> Weight configuration

inputs/ -> Structured templates

examples/ -> Reference usage

src/ -> Reserved for CLI and API implementation

---

## Future Direction

- CLI interface for local execution
- REST API for integration
- Modular scoring engine
- Pluggable evaluation dimensions
- Abstracted evaluation core reusable beyond job contexts

---

## Status

Early architecture foundation (Phase 1).
