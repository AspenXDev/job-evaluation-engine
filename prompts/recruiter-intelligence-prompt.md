# Recruiter Intelligence Prompt (Extension)

When recruiter context is available:

- Adjust interpretation of requirements based on recruiter background.
- Consider cultural and market positioning signals.
- Incorporate language and regional nuance if relevant.
- Reflect inferred recruiter priorities in scoring adjustments.

This layer is optional and modular.
